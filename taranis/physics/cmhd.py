# Compressible (polytropic) MHD, fully spectral.

# Derivation of record: docs/numerics.md, section "Compressible MHD" (Phase C0). Plan and
# scope decisions: plans/CMHD_PLAN.md. Every expression below is a transcription of that
# docs section -- change the docs first, then this file.
#
# Seven fields, in state order (rho, u_x, u_y, u_z, B_x, B_y, B_z). Alfven units
# (B_code = B/sqrt(mu0*rho0), so v_A = |B|/sqrt(rho)), <rho> = rho0 = 1 by convention,
# p = K*rho^gamma with K = cs0^2/gamma so that c_s(rho=1) = cs0.
#
#     d_t rho = -div(rho u)                                     flux form
#     d_t u   = -(curl u) x u - grad(|u|^2/2 + h(rho)) + (curl B) x B / rho
#     d_t B   = curl(u x B)                                     curl form
#
#     h(rho) = cs0^2 * rho^(gamma-1)/(gamma-1)   gamma > 1
#     h(rho) = cs0^2 * ln(rho)                   gamma = 1  (isothermal, the default)
#
# There is NO background/fluctuation split and no linear wave term: B0 and rho0 live in the
# k = 0 modes of the evolved fields, and the waves come out of the quadratic terms. Both
# k = 0 modes are preserved BITWISE by the discrete step (docs/numerics.md), which is what
# the C1 mass / mean-B gates assert.
#
# Three standing rules this module is built on:
#
#  1. L IS DISSIPATION ONLY; THE WAVES STAY EXPLICIT. `linear_matrix` returns the isotropic
#     (hyper-)dissipation diagonal and nothing else. The compressible wave operator couples
#     all seven fields per mode -- there is no 7x7 propagator backend, and IMEX-ing the waves
#     would put an L-stable solve on a wave-dominated L, which the house rule forbids. Never
#     move a wave term into L.
#  2. ANY FUTURE INDUCTION TERM MUST BE A CURL (or k-locally divergence-free). div B is not
#     cleaned, projected or evolved: `i*k x fft(u x B)` makes `k . dB` a pairwise-cancelling
#     sum, so div B only random-walks at machine epsilon, and the propagator and the dealias
#     mask scale all three B components identically (they commute with `k .`). A
#     non-curl induction term would break that for good.
#  3. THE NON-POLYNOMIAL RESIDUAL IS ACCEPTED, NOT HIDDEN. The quadratic products are exactly
#     dealiased by the existing 2/3 mask; h(rho), ln(rho) and 1/rho are not polynomial and no
#     finite padding dealiases them. At smooth rho and M_s <~ 1 the residual sits inside the
#     time-discretization error, which is why the conservation gates assert convergence ORDER
#     plus absolute smallness and NEVER round-off.
#
# Scope (enforced in _check_supported): dims == 3 with z_spectral=True, single process, no
# forcing, no particles. This module holds only what the solver consumes; read-only CMHD
# observers belong in taranis/diagnostics/cmhd.py (Phase C2).
#
# EXPANDING BOX (EBM, Phase C3b; docs/numerics.md "Expanding box"). Optional
# eqpars["expansion"] = {"adot": > 0, "cs_q": >= 0, default 4/3}, isothermal (gamma == 1)
# only. Comoving frame of Squire, Chandran & Meyrand 2020: a(t) = 1 + adot*t, radial axis x,
# transverse (y, z) expanding, comoving gradient grad~ = (d_x, d_y/a, d_z/a). The EVOLVED
# state is then the RESCALED (primed) one,
#
#     rho' = a^2 rho     B' = (a^2 B_x, a B_y, a B_z)     u unscaled
#
# which kills the -2(adot/a)rho and -(adot/a)diag(2,1,1)B expansion terms identically and
# keeps induction a STATIC-k curl of E' = ((u x B)_x, a(u x B)_y, a(u x B)_z). What is left:
#
#     d_t rho' = -grad~ . (rho' u)
#     d_t u    = (the ideal RHS with grad~, h = cs^2(t) ln rho') - (adot/a) diag(0,1,1) u
#     d_t B'   = curl E'                                        (static integer-grid k)
#
# with cs^2(t) = cs0^2 a^(-cs_q). Consequences inherited verbatim from the non-expanding
# argument, and gated in tests/test_cmhd_expansion.py: K.B'^ is a round-off random walk, and
# the k = 0 modes of rho' and B' are BITWISE invariants (so the raw backgrounds track
# rho ~ a^-2, B_x ~ a^-2, B_perp ~ a^-1 exactly).
#
# THE OFF PATH IS BITWISE THE PRE-C3 GRAPH. Everything above is gated on
# `_expansion(params) is None`, plain python at TRACE time (params is static), so not one
# a-factor enters the graph of a non-expanding run -- never a lax.cond, never a multiply by
# a literal 1.0. `test_expansion_off_rhs_does_not_depend_on_t` is the standing gate.
#
# Dissipation is UNCHANGED by expansion: L stays the static diagonal
# -diss_f*(kperp^2 + kz^2)^hyper acting on the PRIMED fields at COMOVING k, which is the
# recorded truncation choice (docs; the physical-wavenumber alternative would need nu(t) or
# per-block L rebuilds). linear_matrix therefore has no expansion branch at all.
#
# THE ln rho DENSITY VARIABLE (Phase C4; docs/numerics.md "The ln rho density variable").
# Optional eqpars["density_var"] in {"rho" (default), "lnrho"}. With "lnrho", FIELD 0 IS
# s = ln rho instead of rho -- an opt-in variable change for POSITIVITY: rho = e^s > 0 is
# structural, so the rarefaction NaN channel the rho form carries is retired, and at the
# transonic target s is the smooth near-Gaussian field where rho has decade-deep valleys.
#
#     d_t s = -u.grad s - div u                     (the flux form divided by rho)
#
#     h = cs^2 * s                     gamma = 1   LINEAR: the pressure force is the
#                                                  k-local -cs^2 * i k~ s^, no transform
#     h = cs0^2 e^((gamma-1)s)/(gamma-1)  gamma > 1  (pointwise, joins the scalar transform)
#
# with 1/rho = e^-s the only non-polynomial factor left at gamma = 1. WHAT THIS COSTS, and
# it is a real cost, not a wash: MASS CHANGES DISCRETE CLASS. In rho-variables mass is the
# single coefficient rho^(k=0) whose RHS projection is an exact fp zero, i.e. bitwise for
# free; the s-form's conserved functional int e^s is NONLINEAR in the evolved field and has
# no linear substitute (<s> is not conserved even in the continuum), so RK preserves it only
# to scheme order. Mass therefore joins the class energy is already in -- gated by drift
# ORDER plus absolute smallness, NEVER at round-off. mean B and div B are untouched
# (induction never sees field 0), and on a SPATIALLY UNIFORM state every s-RHS term is an
# exact fp zero, so s^(k=0) is bitwise there.
#
# EBM composes: with expansion on the evolved field is s' = ln rho' = s + 2 ln a, and the
# -2(adot/a) expansion term cancels identically against d(2 ln a)/dt, so continuity carries
# NO expansion term at all. The raw 1/rho is a^2 e^-s', and h's uniform -2 cs^2(t) ln a dies
# under the gradient exactly as in the rho form. Transform tally 24 (16 inverse / 8 forward),
# one more than the rho form's 23: grad gains grad~s (3) and s (1) = 16, and the term func
# loses (rho u)(3) and gains u.grad s (1) = 8. div u = i k~ . u^ is k-local.
#
# THE "rho" PATH MUST STAY BYTE-IDENTICAL. Like the expansion switch, density_var is a
# TRACE-TIME python branch on the static params (`_density_var(params) == "lnrho"`), never a
# lax.cond and never a select between two computed values -- verified once out of tree over
# three configs (one of them expansion-on) at both precisions, in fields, t and the
# optimized-HLO opcode histogram (plans/CMHD_PLAN.md §5 C4). linear_matrix has ZERO change:
# the field-0 row of the same diagonal L simply acts on s instead of rho.
#
# INITIALIZATION AND DIAGNOSTICS. run.initialize is equation-generic, so nothing there
# changes -- but the user IC function MUST RETURN s = ln rho IN FIELD 0 under "lnrho"
# (fields 1..6 are unchanged u and B). density_var rides eqpars into params.json, so
# params.save's differing-record check is what blocks a cross-mode restart. taranis/
# diagnostics/cmhd.py is rho-ONLY and is NOT density_var-aware: it reads state.fields[0] as
# rho, so on an lnrho state its energies/Mach numbers/spectra/budget are wrong, not merely
# differently normalized. Unscale by hand (rho = e^s) until a helper lands
# (plans/CMHD_PLAN.md §11).
