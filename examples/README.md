# Examples

All notebooks use the current API and run single-process on a laptop (3D ones at modest
resolutions) — a plain `pip install -e .` is enough, with no MPI toolchain: with
`mpi4py`/`mpi4jax` absent, `comm_backend` auto-resolves to `"serial"` (exact size-1
semantics), so no notebook sets it. Performance studies live in `../bench/`, cluster job scripts in
`../slurms/`, correctness tests in `../tests/`. Outputs are written under
`examples/data/` (gitignored).

Suggested order:

1. **orzag-tang-2D.ipynb** — pedagogical introduction (with exercises): decaying 2D
   Orszag–Tang vortex; parameters, initialization, running, snapshots, basic plots.
2. **orzag-tang-3d.ipynb** — the same problem in 3D (z-dependent initial condition).
   - **orzag-tang-3d-spectral-z.ipynb** — the same initial condition run twice at 32³, with
     finite-difference z and with `z_spectral=True` (plans/GDI_PLAN.md P2: axis 1 of
     `state.fields` becomes `kz`, the Alfvén operator moves into the exact linear propagator).
     Energy histories, real-space vorticity, perpendicular and parallel spectra side by side;
     a `dt` vs `nz` scan showing where dropping the `1/dz` CFL term actually pays (nothing at
     `nz ≈ nx` with O(1) amplitudes, 3.7× at `nz = 8·nx`); and the `params.save` guard that
     refuses a cross-mode restart. Single-process only, like the mode itself.
3. **AW_advection.ipynb** — verification: linear Alfvén-wave advection along z against
   the exact solution; error vs kz for the 4th-order z finite-difference scheme and the
   z dissipation filter.
4. **tearing-mode-2D.ipynb** — the classic RMHD validation problem: tearing instability
   of a cos(x) current sheet in inviscid (ν=0) runs, matching the assumptions of
   FKR/Coppi theory; island growth, measured growth rate vs resistivity against the FKR
   (η^3/5) and Coppi (η^1/3) scalings, plus a perturbation-current structure-vs-time GIF
   of the featured run.
5. **tearing-growth-vs-k.ipynb** — the tearing dispersion curve: growth rate vs
   perpendicular wavenumber at fixed η=1e-3 in an *inviscid* run (ν=0, matching the
   assumptions of the exact Coppi relation), ten modes measured from one long-box
   (Ly=16π) fp64 run; analytic Δ'(k)=2κ·tan(πκ/2) (numerically verified), the exact
   Coppi dispersion relation (arbitrary Δ′, both asymptotic limits verified
   numerically), an equilibrium-decay-corrected prediction, a mode-selection
   structure-vs-time GIF, and the peak of γ(k) vs the k ~ η^(1/4) estimate. Extends
   tearing-mode-2D and is cross-checked against it at k=1/2: both notebooks are now
   inviscid, and their independent measurements of γ(k=1/2, η=1e-3) agree to ~1%.
6. **alfven-wave-collision-3D.ipynb** — counter-propagating z⁺/z⁻ Alfvén wave packets
   (the minimal nonlinear RMHD interaction): purely magnetic secondary-mode generation
   and perpendicular cascade onset, with a single-wave control run. Nonlinear companion
   to AW_advection.
7. **forced-turbulence-2D.ipynb** — Ornstein–Uhlenbeck forced 2D MHD turbulence
   (elsasser forcing), including a snapshot save/reload round-trip check.
8. **forcing-modes-2D.ipynb** — momentum vs elsasser forcing side by side, including the
   documented gotcha (2D momentum forcing from rest is pure hydro: psi stays exactly 0)
   and injection-power bookkeeping (measured dE/dt vs `forcing_power` vs dissipation).
9. **forced-turbulence-3D.ipynb** — forced 3D RMHD turbulence.
10. **turbulence-spectra-analysis.ipynb** — analysis of a developed forced-turbulence-3D
   run (generates its own 64³ data if none exists): time-averaged perpendicular spectra,
   Elsasser spectra, residual energy, parallel spectrum (`parspec`, size==1 only), and
   spectral anisotropy.
11. **restart-workflow.ipynb** — the checkpoint lifecycle end to end: `params.save`,
    restart via `Parameters.from_snapshot`/`load_snapshot` (bitwise-identical
    continuation), and restarting with overridden parameters.
12. **postprocessing.ipynb** — loading snapshots from any run (local or copied from a
    cluster) without the solver running: slices, perpendicular spectra, and a 3D
    three-face volume rendering. Run orzag-tang-3d first to generate its input data.
13. **kaggle_forced_turbulence_256cubed.ipynb** — launcher for a 256³ forced-turbulence
    run on a Kaggle GPU instance (environment setup included; not runnable locally).
14. **gdi-2D.ipynb** — the 2D Gradient-Drift-Instability equation set (`eqtype="GDI"`,
    plans/GDI_PLAN.md P4a): a box/eqpars combination chosen by computing the discrete
    growth-rate landscape directly from `physics/gdi.py`'s linear operator (many unstable
    lattice modes, not the single-mode original demo), run through linear growth into a
    **statistically confirmed saturated, broadband turbulent state** — real-space structure,
    a permanent per-mode eigenvector-vs-time check, time-averaged $k_\perp$ spectra (measured
    slopes reported honestly, not forced to a target), the N-phi cross-phase/amplitude-ratio
    and adiabaticity diagnostics (eqs 4.6-4.8) compared against the exact linear-eigenmode
    curve, the energy budget (drive vs. dissipation) in saturation, and an animated GIF of the
    evolution. Retuned twice: a first weak-drive family (`Ln=84, v0=25, nu_in=0.05`, a
    mixing-length estimate) undershot the `max delta n/n ~ 0.3` target; a second, empirical
    **gamma_max-calibration** retune (`Ln=392, v0=25, nu_in=0.0106` — saturation amplitude
    tracks `gamma_max=sqrt(nu_in*v0/Ln)` at fixed `kc`, not `Ln` alone) lands on it: measured
    `max|N| ~ 0.35-0.52` (mean ~0.41), `N_rms ~ 0.11-0.13`, well within the model's own
    perturbative ordering, superseding an earlier strong-drive choice that saturated with
    `delta n/n >> 1`. Data is generated by `examples/gdi_2d_run.py` (resumable, idempotent)
    so the notebook runs from a fresh clone with no bundled/gitignored inputs.
15. **gdi_3d_run.py** — 3D GDI demonstration driver (plans/GDI_PLAN.md P4b; `z_spectral`,
    `D_par` closure, `imexcb3e`): resumable `make_data` plus a `report()` that prints the
    static linear summary and the P4b science diagnostics (`kperp_break`, `measure_alpha`,
    kz-resolved cross-phase). No companion notebook yet, and the shipped configuration is
    NOT saturation-calibrated (documented in the file header) — a demonstration of the
    diagnostics, not a turbulence result.

16. **test-particles-2D.ipynb** — Boris-pushed charged test particles co-stepped with
    forced 2D RMHD turbulence (plans/TESTPART_PLAN.md phases A3/A3b): 4096 particles per
    ensemble, sixteen ensembles aboard each of the two design-(a) 256² hyperviscous runs
    (ν=η=1e-10, hyper=3) and four aboard each of the four design-(b) runs, differing only in
    Ω = (q/m)B₀, initial distribution, the RMHD amplitude B₀ = 1/ε they are interpreted at, or
    *which pieces of the field they are allowed to see*. Measured Xia, Perez, Chandran &
    Quataert (2013) style: production at **B₀ = 10** (δB/B₀ = 0.18, β_i = 0.01) with the
    numerical E∥ left by interpolating **E** and **B** independently (measured at 1.6e-3 of
    |E||B|) projected out per particle, heating read in the **local-B frame**, and rate
    windows that start at t₀ = 10/Ω (after the E×B pickup) and end when ⟨v⊥B²⟩ has grown 20%
    or a 400-step floor is reached, whichever is later. Three ξ-scans — Ω sweep at two forcing
    powers, a ×30 forcing-amplitude sweep, and Xia's fixed-ρ rings — give 22 (Q⊥, ξ) points,
    of which **16 are measurements over ξ = 0.124–0.39** and six are upper limits (a rate not
    2σ above zero is a limit and is held out of every fit). They **do** show the Chandran
    exponential: c₁ = 0.98, **c₂ = 0.40±0.13** (lab v⊥, local-B Q⊥; 0.46±0.09 drift-corrected;
    the amplitude sweep alone gives 0.34±0.10 drift-corrected at R²(norm)=0.86), against
    Chandran et al. 2010's 0.75/0.34 and Xia et al.'s resolution-dependent 0.20–0.44. A
    printed sensitivity table carries the systematics: the frame is worth 0.001 in c₂, the
    drift correction +0.06, the limit rule −0.08 (limits let in as data) to +0.20 (ẑ frame
    with no limit handling), and the design mix 0.31–0.58 — wider than the fit error. It does
    not *discriminate*: a 3-parameter power law Q⊥ ∝ δu^4.5 ρ^-0.45 scores R²(logQ)=0.922
    against the 2-parameter exponential's 0.876 on the same points; the limits are what favour
    the exponential (the power law overshoots the suppressed rings by 6–49×, the exponential
    by 0.4–13.5×) and they want c₂ ≥ 0.34, 0.57 and 0.78, i.e. *more* suppression than fitted.
    The A3 pass's null result (c₂=0.02±0.02) is **not** explained by the amplitude alone: this
    run's B₀=1 cohort gives c₂ = 0.33±0.22 under the same protocol. What B₀ demonstrably
    controls is the channel split — the A3 "2D forces the parallel channel to dominate"
    argument used ψ_rms/ρ where the correct ratio is ψ_rms/(B₀ρ); at B₀=1 the E_z work is
    89–95% of the total and Q∥/Q⊥ = 0.47–0.62, at B₀=10 with identical Ω, ρ, ξ and fields it
    is 3–15% and 0.018–0.025. The first pass's null c₂ is left to its measurement protocol
    (E×B pickup inside the window, no upper-limit handling) and/or its hyper=1 base
    turbulence, which this notebook cannot separate and says so. The machinery is exact where
    it claims to be: per-piece work accumulators close against ½|v|² to 8e-14 (4e-14 of the
    initial kinetic energy) over the 14 ensembles that do work, both controls conserve |v|²
    per particle to ~6e-14 over 30 time units, and `p_z = v_z − (q/m)ψ` holds to 0.5% of its
    scale for the full-∂ψ/∂t ensemble against 120% for the ideal ones. Three honest negatives:
    the projected/unprojected pair differ by only 1.2σ of the 4096-particle sampling error
    (per-particle paired init is the open item), the |j_z|-conditioned ⟨Δv_z²⟩ rises 1.6–1.8×
    across quantiles — but so does the E=0 control's, so it is the v×b⊥ rotation finding
    small-scale structure, not sheet acceleration — and the two D_μ estimators disagree by
    9–41× because the snapshot pair interval is only ~2 gyroperiods. Data is generated by
    **particles_2d_run.py** (resumable, idempotent, wall-clock-bounded `make_data`: four
    spin-ups, two design-(a) runs, four design-(b) runs and a short high-cadence tail — seven
    particle runs in all; 44 min in the generating session and 687 MiB on an M1 laptop, fp64
    throughout, and an executed copy that finds the data on disk only re-does the analysis).

17. **test-particles-3D.ipynb** — the 3D counterpart (plans/TESTPART_PLAN.md §11, phase B3),
    and a **direct literature check**: Xia, Perez, Chandran & Quataert (2013, ApJ 776, 90)
    measured stochastic ion heating in 3D RMHD, so the 2D campaign's c₂ = 0.40±0.13 can be
    compared like for like rather than across a dimensionality gap. Two things make 3D
    different. **B₀ is pinned to 1** (taranis writes RMHD with v_A = 1, so
    E_z = −B₀∂_zφ + ∂ψ/∂t collapses to the ideal −{φ,ψ} only at B₀ = 1): the amplitude
    parameter is the *run's own* ε = u_rms/v_A, set by the forcing power and measured rather
    than assumed, so an amplitude contrast is a different run and β_i = v_⊥² is **locked** to
    ξ = δu(ρ)/v_⊥ — Xia's per-cohort (v_A, L_∥) rescaling is exactly the per-ensemble B₀ the
    solver forbids here. And **the parallel channel is unbounded**: in 2D p_z = v_z − (q/m)ψ
    is an exact invariant of the full-∂ψ/∂t dynamics, in 3D it is not, which is what the
    campaign's second headline measures — against a **matched 2D twin run** (B₀ = 1/ε,
    q/m = Ω_3D, v_th/ε, t·ε, ν/ε, leaving Ω, ρ, ξ and β_i identical) rather than against a
    remembered number. Base turbulence follows Xia: L_∥/L_⊥ = 6, **Laplacian** dissipation at
    Re ≈ 6000 (so the result lands on their measured c₂(Re) trend: 0.44 at Re 2400 → 0.20 at
    38000) with a hyper=3 twin bridging back to the 2D campaign, thirteen ensembles per
    design-(a) run (Ω sweep, Xia's fixed-ρ rings, an unprojected twin, the full-∂ψ/∂t
    ensemble, an E = 0 floor control and a δb = 0 gyration control), and the same protocol as
    2D — local-B frame, E∥ projected out, t₀ = 10/Ω to 1.2×, 2σ upper-limit rule — plus a
    **Xia-comparable fit row that admits every point**, since they quote no error bars and no
    limit rule (in 2D that choice was worth 0.2 in c₂). Data is generated by
    **particles_3d_run.py**, whose size is a configuration choice and not an edit: set
    `TARANIS_P3D_PROFILE` to `smoke` (32²×16, 46 s, 10 MiB — the pipeline check this notebook
    is committed executed against), `mvp` (128²×32, ~1.7 h on an M1 laptop) or `full`
    (256²×64, 13 ensembles × 32768, ≈58 h laptop / ≈6 h on a Kaggle P100, 12.4 GB — the
    production campaign, not yet run). **Under any profile but `full` every number in the
    notebook is a pipeline check and not a physics result**, and the two interpretive sections
    say so. What the smoke run
    does establish: per-piece work closure 6.8e-16 (2.9e-15 of the initial kinetic energy),
    E = 0 and δb = 0 controls flat to ~7e-15 per particle, `mu_of` reproducing the sidecar μ
    column to 7.5e-4, a finite heating-law fit with the limit rule firing, and the 3D p_z
    drift already 38× the 2D twin's discretization floor.

18. **cmhd_orszag_tang.py** — the compressible-MHD equation set (`eqtype="CMHD"`,
    plans/CMHD_PLAN.md) on the standard Orszag–Tang vortex, run as **2.5D** (`dims=3`,
    `z_spectral=True`, `nz=4`, a z-independent IC — CMHD has no 2D path, and the z-independence
    is preserved exactly). Athena's normalization (Stone et al. 2008, ApJS 178, 137 §VIII.4)
    mapped into taranis code units — γ=5/3, c_s=1, v_A=0.6, β=10/3, exact initial energies
    E_kin=0.5, E_mag=0.18, E_int=0.9 — to t=0.5 at 256², with energy traces, Mach numbers, the
    ρ_min rarefaction monitor, a density image and the kinetic/magnetic/density spectra
    (`diagnostics.cmhd`). `--n 128 --no-plot` for a quick pass. The header carries the one
    caveat that matters: the polytropic closure is *exactly* Athena's adiabatic one while the
    flow is smooth (the IC has uniform entropy), and diverges from it for good once shocks form
    around t ≈ 0.13–0.15 — after which the total energy legitimately declines, because this
    model has no heat reservoir. Quantitative comparison belongs in the pre-shock window;
    `tests/test_cmhd_orszag_tang.py` gates it there. No companion notebook.

19. **multigpu_forced_turbulence.py** — the odd one out: not a laptop example but the
    reference **production driver for a cluster**, forced 3D RMHD turbulence over several
    GPUs on `comm_backend="jax"` (shard_map/NCCL). Submit it with
    `../slurms/forced_turbulence_multigpu.sh`; its size and duration are environment
    variables (`TARANIS_NX`, `TARANIS_NZ`, `TARANIS_TEND`, …, listed in its docstring), so
    scaling a run or continuing one never means editing the python — resubmitting the same
    job restarts from the newest snapshot. It also runs on CPU ranks
    (`TARANIS_BACKEND=mpi4jax`) and single-process on a laptop
    (`TARANIS_BACKEND=serial TARANIS_NX=32 TARANIS_NZ=16`), which is the cheap way to check
    a configuration before it queues. Read `../docs/SAVIO_GPU_SETUP.md` §5 first if you are
    going to write your own: the GPU backend has real constraints (`Parameters` before any
    jax device work, `nz` divisible by the GPU count, no `z_spectral`, and z-reducing
    diagnostics need a `comms.shard_call` wrapper).

20. **tearing-viscosity.ipynb** — visco-resistive tearing with field-aligned shear flow through the
    autodiff eigen-harness (`taranis/stability.py`, plans/AUTODIFF_PLAN.md rung 2b item 1): the exact
    visco-resistive layer relation, k_max(Pm, α) by Newton on eigenvalue sensitivities, and what
    viscosity does to the shear suppression (data: **tearing_viscosity_run.py**). Its last section
    compares with **Ofman, Chen, Morrison & Steinolfson 1991** (Phys. Fluids B 3, 1364) on their own
    Harris-sheet parameters (S = 10⁶, ka = 0.5; data: **tearing_ofman_run.py**, ~4 h of solves):
    the no-flow γ(S_v), their eq. 13c (holds to ≤1.3% at Pm = 1, wrong sign at Pm = 100), the R
    sweeps and the sech jet. Both scripts are resumable; the notebook only reads their caches.

To run a 3D example under MPI instead: `pip install -e ".[mpi]"`, convert the notebook to a
script and `mpirun -n <N> python script.py` with `nz % N == 0` (`comm_backend` then
auto-resolves to `"mpi4jax"`). Launching under `mpirun` *without* the extra installed is a
hard error, never a silent single-domain fallback. Multi-GPU is a different transport again
(`comm_backend="jax"`, `srun`, no `--gpu-bind`) — `../docs/SAVIO_GPU_SETUP.md` covers it end
to end.
